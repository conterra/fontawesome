# Font-Awesome Icon Set
This bundle allows you to use font awesome icons as themes extension in map.apps. All available icons can be seen here: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

After installing the bundle to your map.apps installation and adding it to your app you can use the new icons by adding e.g. “iconClass”:”fa-binoculars” to a tool definition inside the app.json. Or, if you have your own custom theme, you can replace all of the map.apps default icons.
